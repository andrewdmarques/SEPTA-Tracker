# SEPTA-Tracker
These scripts predict train arrival times at stations for commuter rail of the Southeaster Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA). The code uses the API and trained machine learning algorithms based on previous month's data logging to estimate the time it takes from a train to arrive at a station of interest.
